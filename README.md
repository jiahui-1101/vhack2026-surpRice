## Case Study & Problem Statement :mag_right:
**Case Study:** Varsity Hackathon 2026 — Case Study 1: Predictive Maintenance for SME Resilience (SDG 9)

---

# 📌 Problem Statement 🔍

## Background

Across ASEAN, SMEs form the backbone of the economy, especially in manufacturing sectors. However, many factories still rely on **reactive or time-based maintenance**, leading to inefficiencies and unexpected disruptions.

---

## Key Challenges

### ⚠️ 1. High Cost of Downtime

Unplanned machine failures can lead to:

* Significant revenue loss
* Reduced productivity
* Expensive recovery and repair costs

In manufacturing, downtime can cost **up to hundreds of millions annually**, making it a critical business risk.

---

### 📉 2. Limited Resources in SMEs

* SMEs operate with **tight budgets and manpower constraints**
* Lack of access to advanced monitoring and analytics tools
* Difficulty in making data-driven operational decisions

---

### 📊 3. Data Without Intelligence

* Factories already collect sensor data (temperature, vibration, load)
* However, this data is often:

  * Fragmented
  * Underutilized
  * Not translated into actionable insights

---

### ⏱️ 4. Reactive Maintenance Approach

* Problems are only detected **after failure occurs**
* Preventive maintenance may replace components too early
* Leads to unnecessary cost and downtime

---

## 🎯 Problem Summary

SMEs lack an intelligent system that can **predict machine failures early, visualize factory operations clearly, and support proactive decision-making.**

---


---

## Introduction :mega:
**SurpRice** is a **Factory Intelligence & Predictive Maintenance Platform** that transforms how SMEs understand and run their production lines. We fuse real‑time sensor data with a living 3D digital twin, so you don’t just read the factory—**you see it, live**.

Our mission is to eliminate the “black box” of machine health and turn operations into a strategic advantage. From detecting anomalies the moment they happen, to simulating future scenarios like adding a new machine or handling demand spikes, SurpRice gives factory managers the confidence to act before problems escalate.

---

## Core Features :star2:

### 1. Real‑Time Sensor Monitoring Digital Twin 🖥️🏭
- **Live 3D Visual Mapping** – Sensor data is mapped directly onto a digital twin of the factory floor.  
- **Spatial Issue Identification** – Problems are shown exactly *where* they occur, not just in a table.  
- **In‑Scene Alerts** – Critical anomalies appear as visual pulses or glowing zones inside the 3D environment.  
- *“You don’t read the factory — you see it, live.”*

### 2. Intelligent Production & Resource Optimizer ⚙️📊
Turn operational data into strategic insight. Instantly see the trade‑offs between **cost, risk, and output** with six pre‑built simulation scenarios:

| Scenario       | Purpose                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| ⚡ Max Speed    | Hit tight deadlines                  |
| 💰 Economic    | Minimize operating cost               |
| ⚖️ Balanced    | Default, risk‑aware production       |
| 🕐 Overtime    | Extra output when demand surges      |
| 📉 Lean        | Reduce waste, maximize efficiency     |
| 🚀 Surge Mode  | Extreme demand handling (emergency)   |

Each scenario updates the 3D twin and KPIs in real time, letting managers explore “what if” without touching a single machine.

### 3. Intelligent Operations Advisory 🧠➕
- **Predictive Detection** – Catch anomalies early before they escalate.
- **Actionable Steps** – Tells you *what* to maintain and *when*.
- **Cost & Downtime Savings** – Shift from reactive to **proactive** maintenance.
- **Decision Intelligence** – Not just data; AI advises the best course of action.
- *“Fix it before it fails.”*

### 4. AI‑Powered Machine Impact Simulator 📈🤖
- **Zero‑Risk Decision Testing** – Simulate the impact of adding a new machine before investing a single dollar.  
- **Live 3D Preview** – The new machine appears instantly in the digital twin, so you see exactly how it fits into your layout.  
- **Instant Feedback Sliders** – Adjust parameters and watch cost, capacity, and risk change in real time.  
- *“Every decision is tested before it becomes a risk.”*

### 5. Anomaly Diagnostics Engine 🚨🔍
- **Real‑Time Detection** – Continuously monitors sensor streams to spot deviations as they happen.
- **Full Breakdown** – For every anomaly, the system tells you:
  - **When & Where** it started
  - **Which metric** is affected (temperature, vibration, load)
  - **Severity level** (Warning vs. Critical)
- **Multi‑Channel Alerts**:
  - 3D pulse rings around the affected machine
  - Highlighted rows in data tables
  - Dedicated anomaly modal with detailed analysis
- *“We don’t just detect failures — we explain them.”*
